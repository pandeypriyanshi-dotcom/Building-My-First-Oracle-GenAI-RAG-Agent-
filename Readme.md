# Building My First Oracle GenAI RAG Agent üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Overview
This project documents my hands-on lab experience of building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent** using **Oracle GenAI Services**.  
The workflow involves creating a **knowledge base**, configuring **data sources**, and deploying an **AI agent** that can answer queries contextually.

## Why I did this?
As a **finance & AI enthusiast with an interest in analytics and decision-making**, I wanted to explore how Generative AI can transform research workflows. Learning to build a GenAI Agent with Oracle gave me exposure to **practical use cases of AI in data retrieval and analysis**, which are relevant in fields like **equity research, financial modeling, and risk analysis**.
<br>I wanted to go beyond traditional tools. Data-driven decision-making is now deeply connected with **AI/ML and analytics**, so learning these technologies became essential for me

## Steps Completed So Far
- Logged in to Oracle LiveLabs and set up the environment (Frankfurt region).  
- Launched the **GenAI RAG Agent** activity.  
- Reached the step of creating a **Knowledge Base** (currently facing errors).  
- Captured progress and documented the journey in this repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Status:** Knowledge Base creation step faced an error. The agent setup is in progress.  
This repo will be updated as the lab continues.


## Key Learnings (till now)
- Hands-on exposure to **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.  
- Initial setup of **GenAI services** and environment configuration.  
- Understanding the role of a **knowledge base** in RAG agents.  

## Next Steps
- Successfully build the **Knowledge Base**.  
- Connect it with the RAG Agent.  
- Run queries and validate responses.  
- Expand the knowledge base with **finance-focused datasets** to explore equity research applications.

## Steps Once Completed

1. Created an **OCI Compartment** for the project.
2. Configured **GenAI service** in the Frankfurt region.
3. Set up a **Knowledge Base** with uploaded documents.
4. Connected the knowledge base to the **RAG Agent**.
5. Deployed the agent and tested queries successfully.

## Key Learnings

* Hands-on understanding of **RAG architecture**.
* How to use **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** for GenAI.
* Integration of knowledge bases for **domain-specific Q&A**.
* Practical exposure to **AI-driven automation**.

## Upcoming Initiatives

* Expand the knowledge base with **finance-focused datasets**.
* Experiment with **multi-agent workflows**.
* Explore how these models can be applied to **equity research & risk analysis**.
